Hospice Volunteer,"Trained hospice volunteers provide caring and compassionate support to terminally ill patients of all faiths. Volunteers are valued members of the hospice support team who offer companionship and a caring presence through readings, prayer, music, meaningful photos, talents or sharing life reviews. Once trained, the commitment can be as little as one hour a week of your presence, with flexibility in visiting times and ongoing support with continuing education and opportunities for growth.","medical/health, education/training, crafts, writing",Not Available,Massachusetts,JHC Hospice Care,"646 Salisbury St, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01609","smack@jhchospice.com, Susan Mack, (508)713-0564",http://www.jhchospice.com,05/13/20,42.29757105,-71.83727032347358
